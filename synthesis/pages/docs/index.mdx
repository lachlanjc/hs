For far too long, we’ve had a crisis of agency, especially for young people. It’s not that we’ve failed to imagine a better world, but we’ve certainly failed to make it happen.

Our current state of affairs can seen more depressing than ever—an unhinged President who represents a shrinking sliver of us, an economy working against us, an environment self-destructing at an exponentially-increasing pace driven by massive corporations. Our politics are nothing short of a national tragedy, dominated by old white men literally selling out our very futures.

## Welcome

This is a guide for the young person who wants to get involved, who wants to fix this mess, from the perspective of a young person trying to fix this mess. Hi there! Let’s get started.

## The internet

*Listen to [“Lovely Day” by alt-J](https://youtu.be/HGP93-5N72I).*

The internet is the great gift of this generation. Time and space both disappear on the web, and we’re able to share things in real-time with people from all over. Though of course CNN covered this year’s shooting as it happened in Parkland, FL, the survivors were able to truly use (social, and traditional) media to create a massive movement. They are a role model to all of us.

Need to start a buzz about a school board meeting? Hundreds of classmates will see an Instagram post. We have power to draw attention to things in a way previous generations never could.

Unfortunately, as soon as the internet was made, white male capitalists started ruining it. However, as is a theme here, we have the power to take it back.

## Creation and consumumption

As explored in [Wener Herzog’s *Lo and Behold*](https://youtu.be/Zc1tZ8JsZvg), the internet was designed to be a fluid medium, and web browsers would be tools where it’d be as easy to create websites as it would be to view them. But a funny thing happened: some early creators on the internet realized that keeping users a few steps away from the actual creation process on the web meant they could be profiting in the middle.

So now, here we are, and people publish on the internet through textboxes on facebook.com and twitter.com, maybe a blog through medium.com or videos on youtube.com. No one really owns their own thoughts anymore, it’s all just database records for companies profiting like never in the history of humanity.

Luckily, we never lost those original tools. They’re actually more accessible than ever, most people just aren’t aware of it. It’s already starting, but a renaissance of creation is just the antidote to a messed-up world.

[Oliver Reichenstein’s “Take the Power Back”](https://ia.net/topics/take-the-power-back) really captures the transition to massive platform owners (“In a bit more than ten years, open became closed, blog became PR, hoodie became suit and Ping Pong turned into golf.”) but how we can recapture our control over the internet (“That’s how revolutions work. Revolutions tend to lead back to where they started.”). Here, talking about young people:

> But instead of protecting them from the evil Internet, teach them to read, write, draw, paint, ask and think. Teach them researching, blogging, FTP. The challenge when you are in is to not become passive. To change from consumer to maker, following to self-thinking, quoter to commentator, liker to publisher, but mostly, from getting angry about headlines of articles you haven’t read to reading precisely, asking questions, researching, fact-checking, thinking clearly and writing carefully.

## Make the new spotlight

Trump got elected because of his ability to draw enormous attention to himself. Even if all he ever had to offer were racist, sexist lies, he sustained a spotlight American voters couldn’t resist staring at. We need to dismantle that system, so a repeat of him can never happen.

That starts with creating our own platforms, that allow us to express ourselves properly. Luckily, we can do that—once you start learning to code, you take back agency over social networks and give yourself the superpowers to build the tools we need. After the 2017 election, I got together with some friends to build [Call to Action](https://www.usecalltoaction.com) in a weekend, allowing anyone to find and call their Congressional Representative. It went viral, garnering 21,000 visitors in 24 hours, and got covered by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/22/call-to-action-lets-you-phone-your-congressperson-with-just-a-tap/), [LifeHacker](https://lifehacker.com/call-to-action-makes-it-easy-to-find-and-call-your-cong-1789232987), and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-09/silicon-valley-fights-trump-in-its-free-time). This is the power you give yourself through being able to code—instead of just making content, you can create platforms to extend new agency to everyone else.

In this century, we need that power more than ever.

## Education

### Stuck at high school forever

As young people, we’re forced to spend a huge portion of our days at school. Just in high school, if your day goes for 7 hours (8am–3pm), you’re spending something like `7 * 180 = 1,260` hours/year, which is over **5,000 hours** over your high school career. 5,000 hours needs to be worth your time.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, there are about 15 million high schoolers in the US. The number of hours students currently in high school in the US will spend there is 75 billion. Maybe read that again—students currently in high school in the US will spend **75 billion hours** there.

<div class="footnote"><h4>Hours in labor</h4><p>Measured in thousands, so adding up <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_203.10.asp">NCES stats on enrollment in high school</a> grades: 1,000 * (4,021 + 3,808 + 3,651 + 3,617) = 15,097,000 students.</p><p>For calculating the hours: 15,000,000 * 5,000 = 75 billion.</p></div>

75 billion hours definitely need to be doing something (besides causing record levels of stress and anxiety). The purpose of high school is ostensibly to educate us with the essential information we need to be productive members of society. We learn about history, language, math, science, technology, culture, etc. But against all semblances of good ideas, we elected Trump (especially white people, both men and women, [here’s the infamous demographic breakdown](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/behind-trumps-victory-divisions-by-race-gender-education/)). So clearly the education 9 in 10 Americans receive has some failings.

### Take your education into your own hands

Beyond the basics of literacy and rough history, high school is trying to make us engaged citizens in our society. What you’ll receive in terms of social education varies widely state-to-state, district-to-district, and even teacher-to-teacher. A few teachers really succeed in brining diverse perspectives into their classrooms, others try but just don’t get far enough. That’s really because in our state-mandated curricula, it’s entirely optional. American teachers are free to teach culture from a privileged perspective, history through white eyes, religion as Christian, literature written by men, math without its history of cultural appropriation, health for cis + straight people. But we are not all privileged, white, Christian, cisgender, or in whatever other majorities. Therefore, it’s critical that we learn to educate ourselves, or we’ll be stuck with a worldview based on stories that don’t include us or our ancestors.

As we educate ourselves, it’s also a great time to educate our peers and teachers with the rest of the story. Read some good articles about a topic that add some context? Email your teacher —they might share those stories with their future classes, or at least have their own perspectives broadened. Mention to your classmates, provide extra narratives in your papers and presentations. **As important as what the curriculum contains is what remains excluded from the curriculum.**

### Represent.

In an English curriculum like AP Lit, you’ll likely find some representation. For example, [reading *Moby Dick*](https://lachlanjc.me/edu/moby-dick/), Ishmael and Queequeg have a little bromance featured on the side throughout the story. Here’s when they first meet, in an inn.

> “Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought I had been his wife.”

Maybe you’ll hear that this is queer representation. But it does not break down any barriers, be clear and proud about what’s happening. And authors that are not out are not representation in themselves. Regardless of speculation on Herman Melville’s sexual orientation, this was long before the queer community could be public, or people really had the language to describe themselves.

<div class="footnote"><h4>Whaling while gay</h4><p>Since he wasn’t out and public then, Melville lived down the street from a cute guy and wrote fantasies into his books, like waking up in an inn room with a cute guy who is “stiff as a pike-staff” and comment that “Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now…” Okay, back to regularly-scheduled programming.</p></div>

A side-bromance is not queer representation. Instead, we need fully-fledged queer and trans characters, and stories written by queer and trans authors. Though big-box movies are [just beginning](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/movies/love-simon-gay-romantic-comedy.html) to realize [gay people exist outside Hollywood](https://youtu.be/3BHyfYiBt5o), there are an enormous number of (young, and adult) stories with real queer representation. (See: [*Leah on the Offbeat*](https://g.co/kgs/3LRoAB)) There’s also amazing poetry, from a new generation of authors like Chen Chen, that capture other parts of the queer experience in a fundamentally different way.

<div class="footnote"><h4>Chen Chen</h4><p>Besides being queer representation from a Chinese-American author, his poetry is fabulous. Warning: may cause you to start writing poetry weekly.</p><p>Read poems like “<a href="http://www.fishousepoems.org/race-to-the-tree/">Race to the Tree</a>.” With his presentation of this story, instead of describing exactly he feels about everything, he describes the structures around his feelings, the interactions, fleeting thoughts. He leaves you to deduce the rest of it, but in doing so, leaves open so many doors for exploring intersections with your own thoughts and experiences. In a classroom, that’s the best thing ever.</p></div>

We also need to remember that LGBTQ+ representation does not exist in a vacuum from other representation—ethnic and racial diversity is equally important. In books like [*Their Eyes Were Watching God*, these intersect wonderfully](https://lachlanjc.me/edu/watching-god). One person can never speak for the entirety of any community, so a plethora of stories from diverse backgrounds bring a better sense to readers. These stories are essential assembled together.

<div class="footnote"><h4>For teachers</h4><p>English teachers can also increase representation through “choice reading”-type units, where students are free to read works of “literary merit” from diverse authors.</p><h4>“Literary merit”</h4><p>But include young adult and queer literature, because the College Board is a few decades behind on that. Yikes.</p></div>

### Read like this

I’ve assembled a gallery of articles you should read if you’re getting started, providing commentary on different issues. Much more important than these *specific* stories is **learning to consume and analyze media** with a critical lens like the ones presented. I don’t want to show a single perspective to adopt about each topic, but emphasize the importance of approaching stories and narratives with context and the tools to unpack them completely.

## Why should I?

*Listen to [“Heaven’s Only Wishful” by MorMor](https://youtu.be/9PvIIn6cc1M).*

Sometimes it can feel discouraging to “have to” do all this emotional and educational labor to educate yourself and your peers. Shouldn’t people do this themselves? (Short answer: Yes.) It is a sometimes-overwhelming amount of work. But in the end, what are we here to do? We can sit by the wayside, or we can [seize the horribleness around us](https://www.vox.com/videos/2018/4/19/17253324/strikethrough-parkland-student-david-hogg-beats-critics) and fix it. The world counts on the younger generations to change the complacent idiocy established by the now-older generations. Finally, we will have to bear the consequences of their inaction and then ours—just like climate change is here to stay, so it’s up to us to fix it.

```
that thing needs to be made
	i dont really care if my story gets told
		but today and tomorrow
			ill make it
	even if im misunderstood again
because
what i leave behind today is what ill start with tomorrow
	and what i can start tomorrow
		 is what i get to leave behind
```

I keep coming back to this idea. What are we here to do? If we have (the privilege to have) the capacity to work on these issues, isn’t it our responsibility? How can we possibly justify to the next generation why we didn’t do anything? If we’re not going to make amazing things happen in our lives, what are we going to do? Our minds, our bodies give us a limited chance, but it’s enough of a chance. Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote it in *Hamilton*’s [“Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story”](https://youtu.be/_gnypiKNaJE), *The New Yorker* captured it stunningly in [“Yearbook.”](https://video.newyorker.com/watch/the-new-yorker-shorts-yearbook) It’s not even about someone telling your story, but it’s not optional to do things with your life if you’ve been given the opportunity.

That’s what we’re here for, after all. So let’s get going.
