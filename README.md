# Education

My school coding projects. These were all created for specific assignments and under tight deadlines :)

- [**Astrocolony**](https://astrocolony.now.sh/) – A brochure about a space colony on Titan. See pictures of the model at the bottom.
- [**Sommeil**](https://sommeil.now.sh/) – A brochure about sleep (in French).
- [**L’Éducation Suisse**](https://swiss-edu.now.sh/) – A presentation about the education system in Switzerland (also in French).
- [**Greenhouse**](https://greenhouse.now.sh/) – Social commentary urging action on climate change.
