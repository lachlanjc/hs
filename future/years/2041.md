By age 40, I’ll have well settled into my life. I’m hopeful I’ll have a stable career, obsessively doing creative-design-something. I cannot even predict exactly what problem I’ll be working on then, as there’s a good chance it doesn’t yet exist or isn’t yet obvious. I probably don’t want to end up stuck with house ownership and things, but perhaps my idealistic young mind will have adjusted.
