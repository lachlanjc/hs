At 20, I’ll still be an ambitious young person, though now in college. I’ll live somewhere else (Providence?), with different people, and be taking interesting university classes. I’ll have totally different daily routines and a new public identity, but undoubtedly still obsessed with side projects on which I’ll be passionately working every day. And probably still writing a lot of JavaScript.
