In 2061 I will be my dad’s age now. I’m most certainly not going to be retiring (like my parents), as I could never be fulfilled without having substantial work every day. The world will likely be nearly unrecognizable, either being a techno-utopia (exceedingly unlikely), having broken down into an unindustrialized dystopia following a pandemic, climate change, or both (less-than-likely), or just a progressed version of now (most scenarios). None of this sounds very appealing, but we’ll be doing the same thing—marching forwards, trying to make good decisions. The specifics of my everyday life are beyond unpredictable.
