year: 2018

Last year was awesome, but this year, I have so much more to do. First, finishing eleventh grade, but making that not suck by having an amazing Hack Club at State High which truly helps the school community. Second, I’ll keep working at Hack Club HQ (as our web designer-developer) trying to maximize Hack Club’s impact. Third, I want to build a political tool that does at least something to rescue American democracy. By summer, I hope to move to San Francisco to intern at [company] building accessible Design Systems. In the fall, I’ll go back to PennApps (a hackathon) to build a new project, then apply to colleges. Generally, going into the future, I want to continue living my life as a proud, public person building rad tools to make the world better.
