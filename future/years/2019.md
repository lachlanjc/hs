year: 2019

In 2019, I’ll come up with a good solution for being in high school for another year (spending half-days at school and doing an internship, graduating early, taking university classes, etc). I hope Hack Club at State High will become a real institution to last into the future, making coding an accessible tool for all students. I’ll surely be working on more coding projects, then be going off to college—an ideal scenario right now would be Brown + taking classes at RISD, but there are many possibilities.
