At 22, I’ll want to experiment with my life. After graduating from college, I might try digital nomadism for at least a few months, moving around and working on a business. Or, I’ll have left college to work on a cause I feel the world pressingly needs, as that’s totally something I would do. In any case, I’ll try to set myself up not to be stuck in the frighteningly-materialistic capitalist slave system for the rest of my life.
