Happy birthday, Max. ðŸŽ‚

Welcome! April 25 is [Max Wofford](https://maxwofford.com/)'s birthday, and the goal of this site (and this repository) is to display his birthday wishes.

### Leave a birthday wish by creating a file [in cards](https://github.com/hackclub/maxday/tree/master/cards)

Name the file after your first name, and place the following lines at the start of it:

    ---
    author: 'your first name, same as filename'
    ---    

Check out this [Mingjie's card](https://github.com/hackclub/maxday/blob/master/cards/mingjie.md) as an example of how to write one.

## Site Setup

1. Clone the repository and enter it
```
git clone https://github.com/hackclub/maxday
cd maxday
```
2. Update submodules (this may take a little while)
```
git submodule init && git submodule update
```
3. Install packages & run
```
yarn && yarn run dev
```
4. It should now be running, open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it
