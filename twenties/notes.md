# 1920s Presentation Notes

We live in a world of consumerism—how did it start in the 1920s? I'm Lachlan Campbell.

This slide deck is hand-coded and typeset using two typefaces designed in the 1920s, **Futura, by Paul Renner**, and **Century Schoolbook, by Morris Fuller Benton**.

- After World War I, as the other presentations have shown, this country had an **economic boom**.
	- Americans were making more money and there was a **huge array of innovative new technologies**
	- so Americans bought these new devices with **credit**, paying over time with interest
	- this has brought a **fundamental shift** in how the economy operates.
- Wealth was not being distributed equally.
	- While per capita income for nation as a whole rose 9%, for the top 1%, it was a 75% rise
	- .1% of Americans held a third of savings, the top 2.3% had two thirds. 80% of families had no savings whatsoever
	- 75% of the population spent almost all of their yearly incomes on consumer goods: food, clothes, radios, and cars
- Let's look at some pictures.
	- Coburn in 1912, *House of a Thousand Windows*. There is **continuing industrial development** after the war, and American cities like New York are seeing more factories, buildings, boats, even skyscrapers.
	- You might remember Lewis Hine, 1920, *Power house mechanic* (working on steam pump). Most Americans at this time are middle/working class, running factories to produce the new cars, clothes, appliances, electronics.
- **New industrial technology** made production faster & cheaper
	- **Mass production** via the assembly line and standardized, interchangeable parts
	- Skyscrapers in New York, Chicago, and St. Louis made possible by elevators
	- Charles Lindbergh proves trans-Atlantic **air travel** feasible (33 hours)
	- The **oil industry** is taking off to provide energy for the homes, buildings, and factories
- New technology was becoming available to the average household.
	- Electricity coming to the homes of the masses
	- Consumer goods: electric lights, washing machines, vacuums, toasters, refrigerators
	- These give one more time for radios, baseball, dance, vacations, movies
	- Theoretically, these new devices would give women, who did almost all the housework, more free time. But in fact, women ended up cleaning better and more frequently.
	- Think about it: today, we have hundreds of even better "time-saving" devices—and iPhones!—but no one has any free time left.
- More pictures.
	- 4 years before being President, Herbert Hoover in 1925, listening to a radio. An upcoming presentation will explore this
	- Paul Strand, 1922, *Akeley Motion Picture Camera*. Movie industry is taking off in the US, much excitement over filmmaking and Hollywood
- Credit & debt
	- Buying all these new devices was expensive, but now they were purchasable on **installment plans** (with interest).
	- It became acceptable to go into debt to maintain the **new American standard of living**.
	- Credit cards—a model of spend now, pay it off later—are the major drivers of this
	- A Ford Model T cost just $300 in 1924 (equivalent to $4200 now)
	- This NYT article from 1928 explains how London bankers thought the U.S. was putting itself in a precarious financial position—and the next decade proved them correct.
- The 1920s was a time of **great technological change**, which drove **huge economic change**.
	- Following the postwar economic boom, new technology means **consumer goods are the primary economic focus**
	- Companies producing these are **profiting** enormously, consumers purchase those with **credit**, which is debt
	- **Advertising** was taking off, telling people what to buy, why and where, including via the radio (rising standard of living for Americans)
	- If you remember one thing: consumerism blew up in the 1920s and helped lead to the modern US economy.
